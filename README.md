# Smart Home Server Infra

This repo contains the setup for my small server that acts as the smart home hub in my house.

The server runs containers like:

- Home Assistant
- WireGuard VPN
- Portainer
- ESPHome
- Node-RED
- Mosquitto
- Zigbee2MQTT

and some more. I am in the process of setting up this repo as the source of truth for what is installed.
